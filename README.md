# Lagrangian Mechanics Simulator

This project is a simulator based on Python and MATLAB for studying classical mechanics using the Lagrangian formulation. It allows the calculation of particle dynamics via the **Euler-Lagrange equations**, whose numerical solutions are obtained using integration methods with different symplectic properties: **Euler-Cromer**, **Runge-Kutta 4** and **Velocity Verlet**.

The main goal of the project is to provide an interactive tool for exploring the relationship between a particle's mass, the potential acting on it, and the **evolution of its motion** over a given time interval, as well as comparing the **short-term and long-term accuracy** and stability of these integration methods in Lagrangian dynamics.
